## Getting Started
<a href="https://herodex.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrernoopener">Click here to start!</a>

- On the home page, a user must first login with their google account by clicking "Login" in the nav bar at the top.
- Once logged in, a user will be redirected to the 'My team' page. Here, the user will be able to view all the characters they've added to their team and search for their favorite character by typing the character name in the search bar.
- After the search results are generated, a user can click the "Details" button for the character they would like to learn more about.
- On the hero details page, a user can view all the information about the character, add/remove the character from user's team, and create, read, and delete reviews.
- A user can update a review that they previously created by clicking the "Edit" button next to the review. Once clicked, they will be redirected to the 'Edit Review' page and the user can write their new review.

## Next Steps

- AAU, I want to be able to view other users' teams.
